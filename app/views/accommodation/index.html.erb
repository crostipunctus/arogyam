        There are two wings at ArogyaM, 
        seperated by a central courtyard where Dhanwantri, 
        the reigning deity of the wellness center is enshrined under the canopy of a forty year old tamarind tree. 
        The guest rooms at ArogyaM are aesthetically designed and tastefully furnished to host guests on single, double and triple occupancy basis. 
        The nine guest rooms in the guest wing are named after various herbs like <i>dhatri</i>, <i>japa</i>, <i>abhaya</i>, <i>aparajitha</i>, and so on.
